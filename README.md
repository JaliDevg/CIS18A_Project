## Description:
The purpose of this project is to create a delivery service program that would allow the customer to select a food item from the menu and deliver it to the desired address. The user's food order must display an order summary and the delivery time for the user should be during the restaurant’s business hours. The user will be able to interact with the program through the console during the selection of food items, when entering the address, and payment information used for the order.
